### A ROS node for robot calibration

This is a ros node used to calibrate the robot for UCSD CSE-276A-23Fall. You can launch calibration by:

`$ ./setup_calibration.sh`

By running the script above you create a tmux session called *calibration*. Then you can start calibrating the robot in the lower right window! 

Here's some function we have implemented / plan to implement:

#### Implemented function
- [x] Press button 'j' to start / stop the car from going forward.
2. Press button 'k' to start / stop the car from spinning in place.
3. Record the interval time of each run.
